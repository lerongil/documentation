# Qiskit 0.11 release notes

## 0.11

We have bumped up Qiskit minor version to 0.11 because IBM Q Provider has bumped up its minor version too. On Aer, we have jumped from 0.2.1 to 0.2.3 because there was an issue detected right after releasing 0.2.2 and before Qiskit 0.11 went online.

### Terra 0.8

No Change

<span id="id571" />

### Aer 0.2

<span id="id572" />

#### New features

*   Added support for multi-controlled phase gates
*   Added optimized anti-diagonal single-qubit gates

#### Improvements

*   Introduced a technique called Fusion that increments performance of circuit execution Tuned threading strategy to gain performance in most common scenarios.
*   Some of the already implemented error models have been polished.

### IBM Q Provider 0.3

The `IBMQProvider` has been updated in order to default to use the new [IBM Q Experience v2](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com). Accessing the legacy IBM Q Experience v1 and QConsole will still be supported during the 0.3.x line until its final deprecation one month from the release. It is encouraged to update to the new IBM Q Experience to take advantage of the new functionality and features.

#### Updating to the new IBM Q Experience v2

If you have credentials for the legacy IBM Q Experience stored on disk, you can make use of the interactive helper:

```python
from qiskit import IBMQ

IBMQ.update_account()
```

For more complex cases or fine tuning your configuration, the following methods are available:

*   the `IBMQ.delete_accounts()` can be used for resetting your configuration file.
*   the `IBMQ.save_account('MY_TOKEN')` method can be used for saving your credentials, following the instructions in the [IBM Q Experience v2](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com) account page.

#### Updating your programs

When using the new IBM Q Experience v2 through the provider, access to backends is done via individual `provider` instances (as opposed to accessing them directly through the `qiskit.IBMQ` object as in previous versions), which allows for more granular control over the project you are using.

You can get a reference to the `providers` that you have access to using the `IBMQ.providers()` and `IBMQ.get_provider()` methods:

```python
from qiskit import IBMQ

provider = IBMQ.load_account()
my_providers = IBMQ.providers()
provider_2 = IBMQ.get_provider(hub='A', group='B', project='C')
```

For convenience, `IBMQ.load_account()` and `IBMQ.enable_account()` will return a provider for the open access project, which is the default in the new IBM Q Experience v2.

For example, the following program in previous versions:

```python
from qiskit import IBMQ

IBMQ.load_accounts()
backend = IBMQ.get_backend('ibmqx4')
backend_2 = IBMQ.get_backend('ibmq_qasm_simulator', hub='HUB2')
```

Would be equivalent to the following program in the current version:

```python
from qiskit import IBMQ

provider = IBMQ.load_account()
backend = provider.get_backend('ibmqx4')
provider_2 = IBMQ.get_provider(hub='HUB2')
backend_2 = provider_2.get_backend('ibmq_qasm_simulator')
```

You can find more information and details in the [IBM Q Provider documentation](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibmq-provider).
