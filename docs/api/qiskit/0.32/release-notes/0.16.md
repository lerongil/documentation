#### New Features

*   Some of the visualization and Jupyter tools, including gate/error map and backend information, have been moved from `qiskit-terra` to `qiskit-ibmq-provider`. They are now under the `qiskit.providers.ibmq.jupyter` and `qiskit.providers.ibmq.visualization`. In addition, you can now use `%iqx_dashboard` to get a dashboard that provides both job and backend information.

#### Changed

*   JSON schema validation is no longer run by default on Qobj objects passed to `qiskit.providers.ibmq.IBMQBackend.run()`. This significantly speeds up the execution of the run() method. Qobj objects are still validated on the server side, and invalid Qobjs will continue to raise exceptions. To force local validation, set `validate_qobj=True` when you invoke `run()`.
