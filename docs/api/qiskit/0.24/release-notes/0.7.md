#### New Features

This release includes several new features and many bug fixes. With this release the interfaces for circuit diagram, histogram, bloch vectors, and state visualizations are declared stable. Additionally, this release includes a defined and standardized bit order/endianness throughout all aspects of Qiskit. These are all declared as stable interfaces in this release which won’t have breaking changes made moving forward, unless there is appropriate and lengthy deprecation periods warning of any coming changes.

There is also the introduction of the following new features:

*   A new ASCII art circuit drawing output mode
*   A new circuit drawing interface off of `QuantumCircuit` objects that enables calls of `circuit.draw()` or `print(circuit)` to render a drawing of circuits
*   A visualizer for drawing the DAG representation of a circuit
*   A new quantum state plot type for hinton diagrams in the local matplotlib based state plots
*   2 new constructor methods off the `QuantumCircuit` class `from_qasm_str()` and `from_qasm_file()` which let you easily create a circuit object from OpenQASM
*   A new function `plot_bloch_multivector()` to plot Bloch vectors from a tensored state vector or density matrix
*   Per-shot measurement results are available in simulators and select devices. These can be accessed by setting the `memory` kwarg to `True` when calling `compile()` or `execute()` and then accessed using the `get_memory()` method on the `Result` object.
*   A `qiskit.quantum_info` module with revamped Pauli objects and methods for working with quantum states
*   New transpile passes for circuit analysis and transformation: `CommutationAnalysis`, `CommutationTransformation`, `CXCancellation`, `Decompose`, `Unroll`, `Optimize1QGates`, `CheckMap`, `CXDirection`, `BarrierBeforeFinalMeasurements`
*   New alternative swap mapper passes in the transpiler: `BasicSwap`, `LookaheadSwap`, `StochasticSwap`
*   More advanced transpiler infrastructure with support for analysis passes, transformation passes, a global `property_set` for the pass manager, and repeat-until control of passes

#### Compatibility Considerations

As part of the 0.7 release the following things have been deprecated and will either be removed or changed in a backwards incompatible manner in a future release. While not strictly necessary these are things to adjust for before the next release to avoid a breaking change.

*   `plot_circuit()`, `latex_circuit_drawer()`, `generate_latex_source()`, and `matplotlib_circuit_drawer()` from qiskit.tools.visualization are deprecated. Instead the `circuit_drawer()` function from the same module should be used, there are kwarg options to mirror the functionality of all the deprecated functions.
*   The current default output of `circuit_drawer()` (using latex and falling back on python) is deprecated and will be changed to just use the `text` output by default in future releases.
*   The `qiskit.wrapper.load_qasm_string()` and `qiskit.wrapper.load_qasm_file()` functions are deprecated and the `QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str()` and `QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_file()` constructor methods should be used instead.
*   The `plot_barriers` and `reverse_bits` keys in the `style` kwarg dictionary are deprecated, instead the `qiskit.tools.visualization.circuit_drawer()` kwargs `plot_barriers` and `reverse_bits` should be used instead.
*   The functions `plot_state()` and `iplot_state()` have been depreciated. Instead the functions `plot_state_*()` and `iplot_state_*()` should be called for the visualization method required.
*   The `skip_transpiler` argument has been deprecated from `compile()` and `execute()`. Instead you can use the `PassManager` directly, just set the `pass_manager` to a blank `PassManager` object with `PassManager()`
*   The `transpile_dag()` function `format` kwarg for emitting different output formats is deprecated, instead you should convert the default output `DAGCircuit` object to the desired format.
*   The unrollers have been deprecated, moving forward only DAG to DAG unrolling will be supported.

Please note that some backwards-incompatible changes have been made during this release. The following notes contain information on how to adapt to these changes.

##### Changes to Result objects

As part of the rewrite of the Results object to be more consistent and a stable interface moving forward a few changes have been made to how you access the data stored in the result object. First the `get_data()` method has been renamed to just `data()`. Accompanying that change is a change in the data format returned by the function. It is now returning the raw data from the backends instead of doing any post-processing. For example, in previous versions you could call:

```python
result = execute(circuit, backend).result()
unitary = result.get_data()['unitary']
print(unitary)
```

and that would return the unitary matrix like:

```python
[[1+0j, 0+0.5j], [0-0.5j][-1+0j]]
```

But now if you call (with the renamed method):

```python
result.data()['unitary']
```

it will return something like:

```python
[[[1, 0], [0, -0.5]], [[0, -0.5], [-1, 0]]]
```

To get the post processed results in the same format as before the 0.7 release you must use the `get_counts()`, `get_statevector()`, and `get_unitary()` methods on the result object instead of `get_data()['counts']`, `get_data()['statevector']`, and `get_data()['unitary']` respectively.

Additionally, support for `len()` and indexing on a `Result` object has been removed. Instead you should deal with the output from the post processed methods on the Result objects.

Also, the `get_snapshot()` and `get_snapshots()` methods from the `Result` class have been removed. Instead you can access the snapshots using `Result.data()['snapshots']`.

##### Changes to Visualization

The largest change made to visualization in the 0.7 release is the removal of Matplotlib and other visualization dependencies from the project requirements. This was done to simplify the requirements and configuration required for installing Qiskit. If you plan to use any visualizations (including all the jupyter magics) except for the `text`, `latex`, and `latex_source` output for the circuit drawer you’ll you must manually ensure that the visualization dependencies are installed. You can leverage the optional requirements to the Qiskit Terra package to do this:

```python
pip install qiskit-terra[visualization]
```

Aside from this there have been changes made to several of the interfaces as part of the stabilization which may have an impact on existing code. The first is the `basis` kwarg in the `circuit_drawer()` function is no longer accepted. If you were relying on the `circuit_drawer()` to adjust the basis gates used in drawing a circuit diagram you will have to do this priort to calling `circuit_drawer()`. For example:

```python
from qiskit.tools import visualization
visualization.circuit_drawer(circuit, basis_gates='x,U,CX')
```

will have to be adjusted to be:

```python
from qiskit import BasicAer
from qiskit import transpiler
from qiskit.tools import visualization
backend = BasicAer.backend('qasm_simulator')
draw_circ = transpiler.transpile(circuit, backend, basis_gates='x,U,CX')
visualization.circuit_drawer(draw_circ)
```

Moving forward the `circuit_drawer()` function will be the sole interface for circuit drawing in the visualization module. Prior to the 0.7 release there were several other functions which either used different output backends or changed the output for drawing circuits. However, all those other functions have been deprecated and that functionality has been integrated as options on `circuit_drawer()`.

For the other visualization functions, `plot_histogram()` and `plot_state()` there are also a few changes to check when upgrading. First is the output from these functions has changed, in prior releases these would interactively show the output visualization. However that has changed to instead return a `matplotlib.Figure` object. This provides much more flexibility and options to interact with the visualization prior to saving or showing it. This will require adjustment to how these functions are consumed. For example, prior to this release when calling:

```python
plot_histogram(counts)
plot_state(rho)
```

would open up new windows (depending on matplotlib backend) to display the visualization. However starting in the 0.7 you’ll have to call `show()` on the output to mirror this behavior. For example:

```python
plot_histogram(counts).show()
plot_state(rho).show()
```

or:

```python
hist_fig = plot_histogram(counts)
state_fig = plot_state(rho)
hist_fig.show()
state_fig.show()
```

Note that this is only for when running outside of Jupyter. No adjustment is required inside a Jupyter environment because Jupyter notebooks natively understand how to render `matplotlib.Figure` objects.

However, returning the Figure object provides additional flexibility for dealing with the output. For example instead of just showing the figure you can now directly save it to a file by leveraging the `savefig()` method. For example:

```python
hist_fig = plot_histogram(counts)
state_fig = plot_state(rho)
hist_fig.savefig('histogram.png')
state_fig.savefig('state_plot.png')
```

The other key aspect which has changed with these functions is when running under jupyter. In the 0.6 release `plot_state()` and `plot_histogram()` when running under jupyter the default behavior was to use the interactive Javascript plots if the externally hosted Javascript library for rendering the visualization was reachable over the network. If not it would just use the matplotlib version. However in the 0.7 release this no longer the case, and separate functions for the interactive plots, `iplot_state()` and `iplot_histogram()` are to be used instead. `plot_state()` and `plot_histogram()` always use the matplotlib versions.

Additionally, starting in this release the `plot_state()` function is deprecated in favor of calling individual methods for each method of plotting a quantum state. While the `plot_state()` function will continue to work until the 0.9 release, it will emit a warning each time it is used. The

| Qiskit Terra 0.6                    | Qiskit Terra 0.7+             |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| plot\_state(rho)                    | plot\_state\_city(rho)        |
| plot\_state(rho, method=’city’)     | plot\_state\_city(rho)        |
| plot\_state(rho, method=’paulivec’) | plot\_state\_paulivec(rho)    |
| plot\_state(rho, method=’qsphere’)  | plot\_state\_qsphere(rho)     |
| plot\_state(rho, method=’bloch’)    | plot\_bloch\_multivector(rho) |
| plot\_state(rho, method=’hinton’)   | plot\_state\_hinton(rho)      |

The same is true for the interactive JS equivalent, `iplot_state()`. The function names are all the same, just with a prepended i for each function. For example, `iplot_state(rho, method='paulivec')` is `iplot_state_paulivec(rho)`.

##### Changes to Backends

With the improvements made in the 0.7 release there are a few things related to backends to keep in mind when upgrading. The biggest change is the restructuring of the provider instances in the root `` qiskit` `` namespace. The `Aer` provider is not installed by default and requires the installation of the `qiskit-aer` package. This package contains the new high performance fully featured simulator. If you installed via `pip install qiskit` you’ll already have this installed. The python simulators are now available under `qiskit.BasicAer` and the old C++ simulators are available with `qiskit.LegacySimulators`. This also means that the implicit fallback to python based simulators when the C++ simulators are not found doesn’t exist anymore. If you ask for a local C++ based simulator backend, and it can’t be found an exception will be raised instead of just using the python simulator instead.

Additionally the previously deprecation top level functions `register()` and `available_backends()` have been removed. Also, the deprecated `backend.parameters()` and `backend.calibration()` methods have been removed in favor of `backend.properties()`. You can refer to the 0.6 release notes section [Working with backends](#backends) for more details on these changes.

The `backend.jobs()` and `backend.retrieve_jobs()` calls no longer return results from those jobs. Instead you must call the `result()` method on the returned jobs objects.

##### Changes to the compiler, transpiler, and unrollers

As part of an effort to stabilize the compiler interfaces there have been several changes to be aware of when leveraging the compiler functions. First it is important to note that the `qiskit.transpiler.transpile()` function now takes a QuantumCircuit object (or a list of them) and returns a QuantumCircuit object (or a list of them). The DAG processing is done internally now.

You can also easily switch between circuits, DAGs, and Qobj now using the functions in `qiskit.converters`.
