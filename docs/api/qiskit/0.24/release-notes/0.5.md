# Qiskit 0.5 release notes

## 0.5

<span id="terra-0-5" />

### Terra 0.5

<span id="id606" />

#### Highlights

This release brings a number of improvements to Qiskit, both for the user experience and under the hood. Please refer to the full changelog for a detailed description of the changes - the highlights are:

*   new `statevector` `simulators` and feature and performance improvements to the existing ones (in particular to the C++ simulator), along with a reorganization of how to work with backends focused on extensibility and flexibility (using aliases and backend providers)
*   reorganization of the asynchronous features, providing a friendlier interface for running jobs asynchronously via `Job` instances
*   numerous improvements and fixes throughout the Terra as a whole, both for convenience of the users (such as allowing anonymous registers) and for enhanced functionality (such as improved plotting of circuits)

#### Compatibility Considerations

Please note that several backwards-incompatible changes have been introduced during this release as a result of the ongoing development. While some of these features will continue to be supported during a period of time before being fully deprecated, it is recommended to update your programs in order to prepare for the new versions and take advantage of the new functionality.

##### `QuantumProgram` changes

Several methods of the `QuantumProgram` class are on their way to being deprecated:

*   methods for interacting **with the backends and the API**:

    The recommended way for opening a connection to the IBM Q API and for using the backends is through the top-level functions directly instead of the `QuantumProgram` methods. In particular, the `qiskit.register()` method provides the equivalent of the previous `qiskit.QuantumProgram.set_api()` call. In a similar vein, there is a new `qiskit.available_backends()`, `qiskit.get_backend()` and related functions for querying the available backends directly. For example, the following snippet for version 0.4:

    ```python
    from qiskit import QuantumProgram

    quantum_program = QuantumProgram()
    quantum_program.set_api(token, url)
    backends = quantum_program.available_backends()
    print(quantum_program.get_backend_status('ibmqx4')
    ```

    would be equivalent to the following snippet for version 0.5:

    ```python
    from qiskit import register, available_backends, get_backend

    register(token, url)
    backends = available_backends()
    backend = get_backend('ibmqx4')
    print(backend.status)
    ```

*   methods for **compiling and executing programs**:

    The top-level functions now also provide equivalents for the `qiskit.QuantumProgram.compile()` and `qiskit.QuantumProgram.execute()` methods. For example, the following snippet from version 0.4:

    ```python
    quantum_program.execute(circuit, args, ...)
    ```

    would be equivalent to the following snippet for version 0.5:

    ```python
    from qiskit import execute

    execute(circuit, args, ...)
    ```

In general, from version 0.5 onwards we encourage to try to make use of the individual objects and classes directly instead of relying on `QuantumProgram`. For example, a `QuantumCircuit` can be instantiated and constructed by appending `QuantumRegister`, `ClassicalRegister`, and gates directly. Please check the update example in the Quickstart section, or the `using_qiskit_core_level_0.py` and `using_qiskit_core_level_1.py` examples on the main repository.

##### Backend name changes

In order to provide a more extensible framework for backends, there have been some design changes accordingly:

*   **local simulator names**

    The names of the local simulators have been homogenized in order to follow the same pattern: `PROVIDERNAME_TYPE_simulator_LANGUAGEORPROJECT` - for example, the C++ simulator previously named `local_qiskit_simulator` is now `local_qasm_simulator_cpp`. An overview of the current simulators:

    *   `QASM` simulator is supposed to be like an experiment. You apply a circuit on some qubits, and observe measurement results - and you repeat for many shots to get a histogram of counts via `result.get_counts()`.
    *   `Statevector` simulator is to get the full statevector ($2^n$ amplitudes) after evolving the zero state through the circuit, and can be obtained via `result.get_statevector()`.
    *   `Unitary` simulator is to get the unitary matrix equivalent of the circuit, returned via `result.get_unitary()`.
    *   In addition, you can get intermediate states from a simulator by applying a `snapshot(slot)` instruction at various spots in the circuit. This will save the current state of the simulator in a given slot, which can later be retrieved via `result.get_snapshot(slot)`.

*   **backend aliases**:

    The SDK now provides an “alias” system that allows for automatically using the most performant simulator of a specific type, if it is available in your system. For example, with the following snippet:

    ```python
    from qiskit import get_backend

    backend = get_backend('local_statevector_simulator')
    ```

    the backend will be the C++ statevector simulator if available, falling back to the Python statevector simulator if not present.

##### More flexible names and parameters

Several functions of the SDK have been made more flexible and user-friendly:

*   **automatic circuit and register names**

    `qiskit.ClassicalRegister`, `qiskit.QuantumRegister` and `qiskit.QuantumCircuit` can now be instantiated without explicitly giving them a name - a new autonaming feature will automatically assign them an identifier:

    ```python
    q = QuantumRegister(2)
    ```

    Please note as well that the order of the parameters have been swapped `QuantumRegister(size, name)`.

*   **methods accepting names or instances**

    In combination with the autonaming changes, several methods such as `qiskit.Result.get_data()` now accept both names and instances for convenience. For example, when retrieving the results for a job that has a single circuit such as:

    ```python
    qc = QuantumCircuit(..., name='my_circuit')
    job = execute(qc, ...)
    result = job.result()
    ```

    The following calls are equivalent:

    ```python
    data = result.get_data('my_circuit')
    data = result.get_data(qc)
    data = result.get_data()
    ```
