# AND

<span id="undefined" />

`AND(num_variable_qubits, flags=None, mcx_mode='noancilla')`

Bases: `qiskit.circuit.quantumcircuit.QuantumCircuit`

A circuit implementing the logical AND operation on a number of qubits.

For the AND operation the state $|1\rangle$ is interpreted as `True`. The result qubit is flipped, if the state of all variable qubits is `True`. In this format, the AND operation equals a multi-controlled X gate, which is controlled on all variable qubits. Using a list of flags however, qubits can be skipped or negated. Practically, the flags allow to skip controls or to apply pre- and post-X gates to the negated qubits.

The AND gate without special flags equals the multi-controlled-X gate:

Using flags we can negate qubits or skip them. For instance, if we have 5 qubits and want to return `True` if the first qubit is `False` and the last two are `True` we use the flags `[-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`.

Create a new logical AND circuit.

**Parameters**

*   **num\_variable\_qubits** (`int`) – The qubits of which the OR is computed. The result will be written into an additional result qubit.
*   **flags** (`Optional`\[`List`\[`int`]]) – A list of +1/0/-1 marking negations or omissions of qubits.
*   **mcx\_mode** (`str`) – The mode to be used to implement the multi-controlled X gate.

**Returns**

a list-like object containing the tuples for the circuit’s data.

### metadata

The user provided metadata associated with the circuit

The metadata for the circuit is a user provided `dict` of metadata for the circuit. It will not be used to influence the execution or operation of the circuit, but it is expected to be passed between all transforms of the circuit (ie transpilation) and that providers will associate any circuit metadata with the results it returns from execution of that circuit.
