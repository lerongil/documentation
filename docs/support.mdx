# Getting help

## IBM Quantum Support

Members of the IBM Quantum Network can reach out to IBM Quantum Support if they have technical difficulties, questions, or concerns. Ask your administrator or IBM representative for IBM Quantum Support contact information.


## Qiskit

For help with Qiskit, access our Slack community: [Qiskit Slack](https://qisk.it/join-slack).

## Qiskit Runtime

- Join the qiskit-runtime channel within the [Qiskit Slack workspace](https://qisk.it/join-slack).

## Open-source governance

The following pages are resources for anyone interested in contributing code to Qiskit.

- [Code of conduct](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [Contributing guide](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Other discussions

Discuss quantum information science and development with the larger quantum computing field on the [Quantum Computing Stack Exchange](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/) site. Be sure to read the ["How do I ask a good question?"](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask) guide, and make use of tags such as `qiskit`, `ibm-runtime`, and `ibm-quantum-services` for best results.

For questions specific to programming, visit [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and use the tag `qiskit`.

## Frequently asked questions

<details>
  <summary>
    How do I cite Qiskit in my research?
  </summary>

Cite Qiskit by using the included [BibTeX file](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/main/CITATION.bib).

  <summary>
    How do I cite an IBM Quantum system in my research?
  </summary>

For research papers, we encourage authors to acknowledge IBM Quantum using:

>    We acknowledge the use of IBM Quantum services for this work. The views expressed are those of the authors, and do not reflect the official policy or position of IBM or the IBM Quantum team.

Paper references should be cited as follows:

> IBM Quantum. https://<span>quantum-computing.ibm.com</span>/, 2021

Systems in the paper should be referenced by their unique name (i.e., `ibmq_vigo`) and optionally
adding the version (i.e., `ibmq_vigo` v1.0.2).  We also encourage referencing the processor.
For example:

> In this paper we used `ibmq_vigo`, which is one of the IBM Quantum Canary processors.

An example of citing an IBM Quantum program:

> IBM Quantum (2022). Estimator primitive (Version x.y.z) [computer software]. https://<span>quantum-computing.ibm.com</span>/

  <summary>
    Why do I receive the error message `AttributeError: QuantumCircuit object has no attribute 'save_state'` when using `save_*`method on a circuit?
  </summary>
  
The `save_*` instructions are part of Qiskit Aer project,
a high performance simulator for quantum circuits. These instructions do not
exist outside of Qiskit Aer and are added dynamically to the
[QuantumCircuit](/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit#quantumcircuit) class by Qiskit Aer on import. If you would like to
use these instructions you must first ensure that you have imported
`qiskit_aer` in your program before trying to call these methods. You
can refer to [qiskit_aer.library](https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/aer/apidocs/aer_library.html) for the details of these custom
instructions included with Qiskit Aer.

<details>
  <summary>
    Why do my results from real devices differ from my results from the simulator?
  </summary>

The simulator models an ideal environment, without noise or decoherence. When jobs are run on the real devices, noise from the environment and decoherence cause the qubits to behave differently than in an ideal environment.
