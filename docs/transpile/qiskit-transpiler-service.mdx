# Transpile circuits remotely with the Qiskit transpiler service

The Qiskit transpiler service provides transpilation capabilities on the cloud. In addition to the local Qiskit transpiler capabilities, your transpilation tasks can benefit from both IBM Quantum Cloud resources and AI-powered transpiler passes.

The Qiskit transpiler service offers a Python library to seamlessly integrate this service and its capabilities into your current Qiskit patterns and workflows.

<Admonition type="note">
    This experimental service is only available for IBM Quantum Premium Plan users.
    The service is an alpha release, subject to change.

## Install the qiskit-transpiler-service package

To use the Qiskit transpiler service, install the `qiskit-transpiler-service` package:

```sh
pip install qiskit-transpiler-service
```

By default, the package tries to authenticate to IBM Quantum services with the defined Qiskit API token, and uses your token from the `QISKIT_IBM_TOKEN` environment variable or from the file `~/.qiskit/qiskit-ibm.json` (under the section `default-ibm-quantum`).

## qiskit-transpiler-service transpile options

- `target` (optional, str) - A backend name as it would be expected by QiskitRuntimeService (for example, `ibm_sherbrooke`). If this is set, the transpile method uses the layout from the specified backend for the transpilation operation. If any other option is set that impacts these settings, such as `coupling_map`, the `target` settings are overridden.
- `coupling_map` (optional, List[List[int]]) - A valid coupling map list (for example, [[0,1],[1,2]]). If this is set, the transpile method uses this coupling map for the transpilation operation. If defined, it overrides any value specified for `target`.
- `optimization_level` (int) - The potential optimization level to apply during the transpilation process. Valid values are [1,2,3], where 1 is the least optimization (and fastest), and 3 the most optimization (and most time-intensive).
- `ai` (bool) - Whether to use AI capabilities during transpilation. The AI capabilities available can be for `AIRouting` transpiling passes or other AI synthesis methods. If this value is `True`, the service applies different AI-powered transpiling passes depending on the `optimization_level` requested.
- `qiskit_transpile_options` (dict) - A Python dictionary object that can include any other option that is valid in the [Qiskit `transpile()` method](defaults-and-configuration-options). If the `qiskit_transpile_options` input includes `optimization_level`, it is discarded in favor of the `optimization_level` specified as parameter input. If the `qiskit_transpile_options` includes any option not recognized by the Qiskit `transpile()` method, the library raises an error.


## Examples

The following examples demonstrate how to transpile circuits using the Qiskit transpiler service with different parameters.

1. Create a random circuit and call the Qiskit transpiler service to transpile the circuit with `ibm_cairo` as the `target`, 1 as the `optimization_level`, and not using AI during the transpilation.

    ```python
    from qiskit.circuit.random import random_circuit
    from qiskit_transpiler_service.transpiler_service import TranspilerService

    random_circ = random_circuit(5, depth=3, seed=42).decompose(reps=3)

    cloud_transpiler_service = TranspilerService(
        target="ibm_cairo",
        ai=False,
        optimization_level=1,
    )
    transpiled_circuit = cloud_transpiler_service.run(random_circ)
    ```

1. Produce a similar random circuit and transpile it, requesting AI transpiling capabilities by setting the flag `ai` to `True`:

    ```python
    from qiskit.circuit.random import random_circuit
    from qiskit_transpiler_service.transpiler_service import TranspilerService

    random_circ = random_circuit(5, depth=3, seed=42).decompose(reps=3)

    cloud_transpiler_service = TranspilerService(
        target="ibm_cairo",
        ai=True,
        optimization_level=1,
    )
    transpiled_circuit = cloud_transpiler_service.run(random_circ)
    ```
