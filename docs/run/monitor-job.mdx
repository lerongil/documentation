# Monitor a job

Jobs are listed on the Jobs page for your quantum service channel:

*   IBM Cloud channel: From the IBM Cloud console quantum [Instances page](https://cloud.ibm.com/quantum/instances), click the name of your instance, then click the Jobs tab.
*   IBM Quantum channel: In IBM Quantum Platform, open the [Jobs page](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/jobs).

Use the job instance to check the job status or retrieve the results by calling the appropriate command:

|                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| job.result()                  | Review job results immediately after the job completes. Job results are available after the job completes. Therefore, job.result() is a blocking call until the job completes.                               |
| job.job\_id()                 | Return the ID that uniquely identifies that job. Retrieving the job results at a later time requires the job ID. Therefore, it is recommended that you save the IDs of jobs you might want to retrieve later. |
| job.status()                  | Check the job status.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| job = service.job(\<job\_id>) | Retrieve a job you previously submitted. This call requires the job ID.                                                                                                                                      |

## Retrieve job results at a later time

Call `service.job(\<job\how_toID>)` to retrieve a job you previously submitted. If you donâ€™t have the job ID, or if you want to retrieve multiple jobs at once; including jobs from retired systems, call `service.jobs()` with optional filters instead. See [QiskitRuntimeService.jobs](../api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService#jobs).

<Admonition type="note">
  service.jobs() returns only Qiskit Runtime jobs. To retrieve other jobs, use [qiskit-ibm-provider](../api/qiskit-ibm-provider/qiskit_ibm_provider.IBMBackend#ibmbackend) instead.
</Admonition>

## Example

This example returns the 10 most recent runtime jobs that were run on `my_backend`:

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

# Initialize the account first.
service = QiskitRuntimeService()

service.jobs(backend_name=my_backend)
```

## Qiskit tools (`qiskit.tools`)

For more information, see the [Qiskit tools documentation](/api/qiskit/tools) in the Qiskit Terra API reference.
