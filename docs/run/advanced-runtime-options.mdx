# Advanced Qiskit Runtime options

When calling the primitives, you can pass in options by using the `Options` class or when using the `run` method. In the `Options` class, commonly used options, such as `resilience_level`, are at the first level. Other options are grouped into different categories:

<Admonition type="info" title="Attention">
    This section focuses on Qiskit Runtime primitive [Options](../api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.options.Options) (imported from `qiskit_ibm_runtime`). While most of the `primitives` interface is common across implementations, most `Options` are not. Consult the
    corresponding API references for information about the `qiskit.primitives` and `qiskit_aer.primitives` options.

## Instantiate the Options class

In the example below, we create an instance of the `Options` class. `optimization_level` is a first-level option and can be passed as an input parameter. Options related to the execution environment are passed using the `environment` parameter.

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import Options

options = Options(optimization_level=3, environment={"log_level": "INFO"})
```

The `Options` class supports auto-complete. Once you create an instance of the `Options` class, you can use auto-complete to see what options are available. If you choose one of the categories, you can use auto-complete again to see what options are available under that category. 

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import Options

options = Options()
options.resilience_level = 1
options.execution.shots = 2048
```
## Pass options to a primitive

### Options class

When creating an instance of the `Estimator` or `Sampler` class, you can pass in the `options` you just created. Those options will then be applied when you use `run()` to perform the calculation.  Example: 


```python
estimator = Estimator(session=backend, options=options)
result = estimator.run(circuit, observable).result()
print(f">>> Metadata: {result.metadata[0]}")
```
### Run() method

You can pass in options by using the `run()` method. This overwrites the options you specified when creating the `Estimator` or `Sampler` instance for that particular execution. 

Because most users will only overwrite a few options at the job level, it is not necessary to specify the category the options are in. The code below, for example, specifies `shots=1024` instead of `execution={"shots": 1024}` (which is also valid). 

```python
estimator = Estimator(session=backend, options=options)
result = estimator.run(circuit, observable, shots=1024).result()
print(f">>> Metadata: {result.metadata[0]}")
```

## Commonly used options

There are many available options, but the following are the most commonly used:

### Shots


For some algorithms, setting a specific number of shots is a core part of their routines. Previously, shots could be set during the call to `backend.run()`. For example, `backend.run(shots=1024)`. Now, that setting is part of the execution
options ("second level option"). This can be done during the primitive setup:

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import Estimator, Options

options = Options()
options.execution.shots = 1024

estimator = Estimator(session=backend, options=options)
```

If you need to modify the number of shots set between iterations (primitive calls), you can set the
shots directly in the `run()` method. This overwrites the initial `shots` setting.

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import Estimator

estimator = Estimator(session=backend)

estimator.run(circuits=circuits, observables=observables, shots=50)

# other logic

estimator.run(circuits=circuits, observables=observables, shots=100)
```

For more information about the primitive options, refer to the
[Options class API reference](../api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.options.Options).


### Runtime compilation

The Qiskit Runtime primitives expect to be called with circuits already suitable for execution on the target system. This implies that the user has already transpiled their circuits to respect the native gate set and connectivity constraints of the target system.

The Qiskit Runtime primitives may perform additional runtime compilation to optimize circuits, with the degree of optimization controlled by an optimization level option. The optimization level you choose affects the compilation strategy, with higher levels invoking more expensive or aggressive optimizations.

See the Optimization level table in the
[Runtime compilation topic](configure-runtime-compilation#set-the-optimization-level) for further details.

<Admonition>
    In the currently deployed Qiskit Runtime primitives, optimization levels 2 and 3 behave identically to level 1. If you want to use more advanced optimization, use the Qiskit transpiler locally, set [`skip_transpilation=True`](../api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.options.TranspilationOptions#skip_transpilation), and then pass the transpiled circuits to the primitives.  For instructions see the [Submitting user-transpiled circuits using primitives](https://learning.quantum-computing.ibm.com/tutorial/submitting-user-transpiled-circuits-using-primitives) tutorial.
</Admonition>

The optimization level option is a "first-level option", and can be set as follows:

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import Estimator, Options

options = Options(optimization_level=1)

# or..
options = Options()
options.optimization_level = 1

estimator = Estimator(session=backend, options=options)
```

Turning off all optional runtime compilation steps requires a "second-level option", as follows:

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import Estimator, Options

options = Options()
options.transpilation.skip_transpilation = True

estimator = Estimator(session=backend, options=options)
```

For more information and a complete list of advanced transpilation options, see the Advanced transpilation options table in the
[Runtime compilation topic](configure-runtime-compilation#transpilation-table).


### Error mitigation


You might want to leverage different error mitigation methods and see how these affect the performance of your
algorithm. These can also be set through the `resilience_level` option. The method selected for each level is
different for `Sampler` and `Estimator`. You can find more information in the
[Configure error mitigation topic](configure-error-mitigation).

The configuration is similar to the other options:

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import Estimator, Options

options = Options(resilience_level = 2)

# or...

options = Options()
options.resilience_level = 2

estimator = Estimator(session=backend, options=options)
```
