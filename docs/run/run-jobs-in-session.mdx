# Run jobs in a session

There are several ways to set up and use [sessions](sessions).  It is recommended that you do not run a session with a single job in it.

## Set up to use sessions

Before starting a session, you must [set up Qiskit Runtime](../start/install) and initialize it as a service:

``` python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, Session, Sampler, Estimator

service = QiskitRuntimeService()
```

## Open a session

You can open a runtime session by using the context manager `with Session(...)` or by initializing the `Session`
class. The session starts when its first job begins execution. 

<Admonition type="note" title="Important">
    If the first session job is canceled, subsequent session jobs will all fail.
</Admonition>


**Session class**

``` python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import Session, Sampler, Estimator

session = Session(service=service, backend="ibmq_qasm_simulator")
estimator = Estimator(session=session)
sampler = Sampler(session=session)
```

**Context manager**

The context manager automatically opens and closes the session.

``` python
with Session(service=service, backend="ibmq_qasm_simulator"):
  estimator = Estimator()
  sampler = Sampler()
```

When you start a session,  you must specify a backend. This can be done by specifying its name or by passing a backend object. 

**Specify a backend by name**

``` python
service = QiskitRuntimeService()
with Session(service=service, backend="ibmq_qasm_simulator"):
    ...
```

**Pass a backend object** 

``` python
backend = service.get_backend("ibmq_qasm_simulator")
with Session(backend=backend):
  ...
```

## Session length

You can define the maximum session timeout with the max_time parameter. This should exceed the longest job's execution time and be within the system's limits. 

``` python
with Session(service=service, backend=backend, max_time="25m"):
  ...   
```

There is also an interactive timeout value (ITTL, or interactive time to live) that cannot be configured.  If no session jobs are queued within that window, the session is temporarily deactivated. To determine a session's ITTL, follow the instructions in [Determine session details](#session-details) and look for the `interactive_timeout` value.

<span id="close"></span>
## Close a session 

A session automatically closes when it exits the context manager. With qiskit-ibm-runtime 0.13 or later releases, when the session context manager is exited, the session is put into "In progress, not accepting new jobs" status. This means that the session finishes processing all running or queued jobs until the maximum timeout value is reached. After all jobs are completed, the session is immediately closed. This allows the scheduler to run the next job without waiting for the session interactive timeout, thereby reducing the average job queuing time. You cannot submit jobs to a closed session.

``` python
with Session(service=service, backend=backend) as session:
    estimator = Estimator()
    job1 = estimator.run(...)
    job2 = estimator.run(...)
    
# The session is no longer accepting jobs but the submitted job will run to completion.    
result = job1.result()
result2 = job2.result()
```

If you are not using a context manager, it's good practice to manually close the session once all the necessary results have been retrieved. With qiskit-ibm-runtime 0.13 or later releases, when a session is closed with `session.close()`, it no longer accepts new jobs, but the already submitted jobs will still run until completion and their results can be retrieved. Prior to qiskit-ibm-runtime 0.13, when a session is closed with `session.close()`, any jobs that are already running continue to run, but any queued jobs remaining in the session are put into a failed state.

``` python
session = Session(backend=backend)
estimator = Estimator(session=session)
job1 = estimator.run(...)
job2 = estimator.run(...)
print(f"Result1: {job1.result()}")
print(f"Result2: {job2.result()}")

# Manually close the session. Running and queued jobs will run to completion.
session.close()
```

<Admonition type="caution" title="When the root job is canceled">
Note that when you cancel the root job in the session (the job which has the same ID as the session), the session closes and fails any remaining queued jobs in the session.
</Admonition>

<span id="cancel"></span>
## Cancel a session 

Canceling a session immediately closes it, failing all queued jobs and preventing new submission. Use the `session.cancel()` method to cancel a session.  Any jobs that are already running continue to run but queued jobs are put into a failed state and no further jobs can be submitted to the session. This is a convenient way to quickly fail all queued jobs within a session. 

``` python
with Session(service=service, backend=backend) as session:
    estimator = Estimator()
    job1 = estimator.run(...)
    job2 = estimator.run(...)
    # You can use session.cancel() to fail all pending jobs, for example, 
    # if you realize you made a mistake.
    session.cancel()
```


## Invoke multiple primitives in a session

A session can handle multiple primitives, allowing for various operations within a single session.  The following example shows how you can create both an instance of the `Sampler` class and one of the `Estimator` class and invoke their `run()` methods within a session. 

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import Session, Sampler, Estimator

with Session(backend=backend):
    sampler = Sampler()
    estimator = Estimator()

    result = sampler.run(sampler_circuit).result()
    print(f">>> Quasi-probability distribution from the sampler job: {result.quasi_dists[0]}")

    result = estimator.run(circuit, observable).result()
    print(f">>> Expectation value from the estimator job: {result.values[0]}")
    ```

## Check session status

You can query a session's status to understand its current state by using  `session.status()` or on the Jobs page for your channel.

Session status can be one of the following:

- `Pending`: The session has not started or has been deactivated. The next session job needs to wait in the queue like other jobs. 
- `In progress, accepting new jobs`: The session is active and accepting new jobs.
- `In progress, not accepting new jobs`: The session is active but not accepting new jobs. Job submission to the session is rejected, but outstanding session jobs will run to completion. The session is automatically closed once all jobs finish. 
- `Closed`: The session's maximum timeout value has been reached or the session was explicitly closed.

## Determine session details

For a comprehensive overview of a session's configuration and status, use the  `session.details() method`. 

``` python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

service = QiskitRuntimeService()

with Session(service=service, backend="ibmq_qasm_simulator") as session:
    estimator = Estimator()
    job = estimator.run(circuit, observable)
    print(session.details())
```

 You can also view session details on the [Quantum Platform Jobs page](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/jobs) or on the IBM Cloud Jobs page, which you access from your [Instances page](https://cloud.ibm.com/quantum/instances).
